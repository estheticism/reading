I enjoyed reading these.

# [The Dulling of Art and Expression](https://cynthesia.substack.com/p/the-dulling-of-art-and-expression)
> Most people just don’t get this kind of art, which grants them the excuse of it being for more enlightened individuals. However that also falls through when the museum will attach a direct explanation beside it explaining both what the piece is and how you’re supposed to experience it. This automatically discredits it’s nuance or value because any deeper meaning which may have been able to be had is eliminated in favor of how it’s supposed to be thought of and felt. If you ignore these instructions, you probably won’t get much out of it (these sections are often empty), **if you read them you don’t have a reason to look at the art again because you understand it now.**

# [The Suboptimization of Music](https://cynthesia.substack.com/p/the-suboptimization-of-music)
> Like many things, (popular) music has become exponentially more boring in recent times. Somewhere along the way it seems the people in charge forgot that there’s more to a song than something which is merely pleasant (if that) to listen to.

> We’re currently in an era of extreme “optimization” and that word is in quotes because for the most part these optimizations merely mean to take things away to provide an image of efficiency, mostly to the products determent. Notice how everything looks the same, cars, clothes, companies, all rapidly adapted to the climate and become indistinguishable from each other.
